// c lab 4 (12/8/24)
//q1 - wap to find a matrix of small dimensions in a matrix of larger dimensions
// eg: {{1,2,3,4,5,6,7},
//      {3,4,5,6,7,8,9},
//      {2,3,2,3,4,4,5}};
//
// to search : {{1,2},
//              {3,4}}
// given a 3*7 == (m*n) matrix
// now ask user to input a 2*2 == (p*q) matrix and search it in the bigger matrix
// also find if the matrix to be searched is there in another orientation or not 
// i.e. rotated by 90deg, 180deg, -90deg it is also to be found out and displayed

// solution coming soon
