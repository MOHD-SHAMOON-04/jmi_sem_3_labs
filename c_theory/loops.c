// Practise Questions : (try yourself)
// Q1 : Sum of Natural Numbers: Write a C program using a for loop to calculate the sum 
//      of the first n natural numbers. The value of n should be provided by the user.

// Q2 : Factorial of a Number: Write a C program to calculate the factorial of a given 
//      number using a while loop. Factorial of n is the product of all positive integers up to n.

// Q3 : Reverse a Number: Write a C program to reverse a given integer using a do-while loop.
//      For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 4321.

// Q4 : Multiplication Table: Write a C program to print the multiplication table of a 
//      number provided by the user. Use a for loop to generate the table.

// Q5 : Sum of Digits: Write a C program to find the sum of digits of a number using a while loop.
//      For example, for the number 234, the sum would be 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

// Q6 : Fibonacci Series: Write a C program to print the first n terms of the Fibonacci series
//      using a for loop. The series starts as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... where each number is
//      the sum of the previous two numbers.

// Q7 : Palindrome Check: Write a C program to check if a number is a palindrome using a
//      do-while loop. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

// Q8 : Prime Number Check: Write a C program to check if a given number is prime or not 
//      using a for loop. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other 
//      than 1 and itself.

// Q9 : Power Calculation: Write a C program to calculate x^y (x raised to the power of y) 
//      using a while loop. The values of x and y should be entered by the user.

// Q10 : Print Pattern: Write a C program to print the following pattern using nested for loops,
//      where n is the number of rows:
//      *
//      * *
//      * * *
//      * * * *
