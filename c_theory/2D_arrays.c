// Practise Questions : (try yourself)
// Q1 : Matrix Input and Display: Write a C program to take input for a 2x2 matrix and then display
//       the matrix in matrix format.

// Q2 : Sum of Elements in a Matrix: Write a C program to find the sum of all elements in a 
//      3x3 matrix. Input the matrix from the user.

// Q3 : Matrix Addition: Write a C program to perform matrix addition. The program should take 
//      two 3x3 matrices as input and output their sum.

// Q4 : Matrix Multiplication: Write a C program to perform matrix multiplication of two 3x3 
//      matrices. The program should output the resulting matrix after multiplication.

// Q5 : Transpose of a Matrix: Write a C program to find the transpose of a 3x3 matrix. 
//      The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping rows and columns.

// Q6 : Row-wise and Column-wise Sum: Write a C program to find the sum of each row and each 
//      column in a 3x3 matrix.

// Q7 : Find Maximum Element in a Matrix: Write a C program to find the maximum element in a 
//      4x4 matrix. The matrix should be input by the user.

// Q8 : Check Identity Matrix: Write a C program to check whether a given 3x3 matrix is an 
//      identity matrix. An identity matrix has 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere.

// Q9 : Matrix Diagonal Sum: Write a C program to find the sum of the diagonal elements of a 
//      square matrix. The matrix size should be input by the user (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4).

// Q10 : Sparse Matrix Check: Write a C program to check if a matrix is a sparse matrix. 
//      A sparse matrix is one where the number of zero elements is greater than the 
//      number of non-zero elements.
